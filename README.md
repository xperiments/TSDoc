# TSDoc #

A [JSDoc3](http://usejsdoc.org/) base themed generator generator for use with Typescript Projects, uses a highly modified version [Docstrap](https://github.com/terryweiss/docstrap/) JsDoc3 Template. 

Actually it only supports parsing of plain comments, also it needs some added "manual" annotation. You can see an output [Example](http://xperiments.github.io/TSDoc/docs/index.html).
